# Practice_Chat_Bot 
ðŸ¤– Practice Chatbot using Hugging Face Transformers Project Description:  Developed a conversational AI chatbot using the Hugging Face Transformers library and pretrained models like DialoGPT or BlenderBot. The project focused on understanding the architecture of transformer-based models for natural language understanding and generation.  Key Features:  Integrated Hugging Faceâ€™s transformers and datasets libraries to utilize pretrained conversational models.  Implemented an interactive user interface using Python (CLI or Streamlit for web-based version).  Fine-tuned response formatting and dialogue flow for natural conversations.  Employed tokenization, attention masks, and contextual embeddings for managing dynamic input/output.  Added functionality to handle greetings, FAQs, and small talk for a realistic chatbot experience.  Skills Used: Python, NLP, Hugging Face Transformers, Pretrained Models, Tokenization, Chatbot Design, Dialog Management.
